On top of needing to add class diagrams and sequence diagrams to it, we also noticed there were some use cases we should document. The most notable case was how we would let the user differentiate between a weak signal and confused input. We are also going to add drawings of each of our use cases to help clarify them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, the presentation's mostly outlined. We'll get to filling in the content for the presentation over the weekend (including rudimentary storyboards for our presentations that'll likely be in *.xcf or *.svg format) and adding more documentation on our experiments with the Emotiv SDK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>group meeting</category><category>presentation</category><category>presentation prep</category><category>requirements</category><category>tech docs</category><guid>/posts/group-meeting-1/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2014 04:58:22 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
