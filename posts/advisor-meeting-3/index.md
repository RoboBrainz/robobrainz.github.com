We met with our advisor from 10:20-11:00 and reported our progress. Here were the major points of the meeting:
# Joan
* Got a test app to compile against the Emotiv EPOC SDK
* Still confused on how to layout the sequence diagrams, so I put those on Google Drive for the advisor to look at
* Start working on a rudimentary AI
* Start working on basic Arduino <-> Computer <-> "EPOC" communication while waiting for the device to come in
* The manufacturers of the EPOC had a delay in receiving the parts they needed, so they're going to come at the end of the month
# Drew
* Got an LED demonstration program running on the device
* Got the front two motors hooked up to the device
* Still puzzled on where to hook up the back tow motors
