We were able to get the sample programs included in the arduino SDK to run on the arduino board we ordered. Check out the [screenshots](/galleries/Arduino_Test/)! We'll also probably upload the code to the project site later (even though it's just a modified version of Blink to see if phora could understand the calls that the program made).
