After inspecting the specs for all of the desktops, turns out it was just the computers' fault. The rest of the time was spent waiting for the packages to finish installing. The reason why we installed Arch Linux on these computers was:\n\nReady access to the software we need (Arduino SDK and several dependencies for the Emotiv EPOC SDK) through the AUR\nphora has experience with Arch Linux packaging since she has an Arch Linux desktop\nIt is easy to install only the packages needed\n\nAnd the packages and packages we installed on the machines were:\n\nbase{,-devel} - Required for all Arch Linux machines. base-devel is an assumed prerequisite for using the AUR.\nkdebase - Easy to set up, ultra-customizable GUI\nkdegraphics-{gwenview,okular} - Basic needs (image viewing, pdf viewing)\ngimp - For editing our concept art\ndia - For editing our concept diagrams\nandroid-sdk{,-platform-tools} - In case we need to develop any android applications\neclipse-android - In case we need to develop any android applications\narduino - To start programming basic functionality in the robot\nqtcurve - To keep all GUI widget themes consistent (this is important for the accessibility problems mentioned in Emotiv EPOC SDK Experiments).

Also makes changing the color and styling without much technical knowhow.\nfirefox - Basic needs (browsing)\n\nIn other news, an email just came in on 2014-11-07 stating that there was an unexpected turn of circumstances that provided. I applied for the refund, especially since we need the tests to be as early as possible. This will mean we have to look at alternate hardware while waiting for it to come in and/or develop any demo code for the EEG device earlier than expected (since the shipments are still applicable even after the refunds).",

Including the Android app in the storyboards gives the illusion that Android middleman software will be essential to the functioning of the program.\nUsing the 1Sheeld may reduce the amount of Android code needed.\nKeep it as optional in case the middleman software makes it easier to write the code.\nWrite the use cases to optionally communicate with the 1sheeld for debugging purposes.\n\n\nFound the data faker program in the Emotiv Epoc SDK (the binary's EmoComposer). Further comments about EmoComposer are in the experiments post.\nCan the data faker program be hooked up to the robot? That would be handy to debug the robot in case the headset readings get funky.\nSet up the presentation permissions for our advisor ASAP.\nMeet with the advisor again (likely on own) at approximately 09:30 on 2014-10-28\nSince we'll need a decent draft of our presentation to show to our advisor, pretend that the presentation is due on Tuesday.\nFurther comments on the presentation will be emailed.\n\n\n\nPersonal notes that're related to the meeting\n\nThe theme for the website could be updated. It looks a little plain compared to my personal site.\nStart learning about how heuristic functions are used in AI.\nLook at the Numenta NUPIC code.\nI should probably enable some form of commenting system on the blog.

      "title": "Emotiv EPOC SDK Experiments",
      "text": "So I started playing around with the SDK and the SDK's provided tools. I've kept some screenshots to highlight some of the usability problems I encountered. The first two screenshots highlight aesthetic usability issues in EmoComposer since it tries to stick out with its widgets. The same could be said for the EmotivControlPanel, which also sticks out due to the custom styling on the buttons and other widgets. While I do have experience with writing Qt Style Sheets and the EmotivControlPanel even supports loading a custom stylesheet, this functionality is useless without documenting the widgets used to construct the interface. I'd recommend the Emotiv developers document what widgets the users need to write the stylesheets for for their SDK tools and/or remove all custom styling except for the custom widgets should they stick with a proprietary model. Personally, I'd prefer a combination of both so the Emotiv developers can keep their custom styling with a stylesheet, but allow the users to turn this off in case they can't easily read the interface.\nOther than that, the EmotivControlPanel works just as expected when tested with the EmoComposer, even though I frequently confused the \"Push Skill\" slider with carrying out the \"Push\" outside of training mode for the Affectiv Suite. The documentation does not mention that the EmoComposer can't save user profiles to it. Trying to do so will cause the EmotivControlPanel to freeze, requiring the user to manually kill the application.\nSurprisingly, the EmoKey and the TestBench software don't stick out as much. The only issues I encountered with it were not triggering when the blink button was pressed in EmoComposer, not fully closing even after \"Quit\" is clicked on the system tray (which again, requires the application to be killed manually), and not launching keybindings such as Alt+F3 (which brings up the window management menu for me) and Ctrl+Space (which launches Kupfer). Even with the QListView's row coloring, the custom colors are done correctly since it defines both a foreground color and a background color. This makes the software more accessible to people with unusual color schemes.\nI haven't been able to test the TestBench software since it has no ability to connect with the EmoComposer. Hopefully this'll change in the future, but I don't know what changes will be necessary to do this. At least it closes properly when Application \u2192 Quit is selected.\nI will also be documenting any experiences I have with Emotiv's developers in the future.

The order consisted of:\n* 1 Multi-Chassis - 4WD Kit (Basic) - A rectangular chassis that has four independently-motorized wheels\n* 2 Motor Driver 1A Dual TB6612FNG - The intermediaries between the microcontroller (essentially the robot's brain) and the motors\n* 1 5 Pack of 5mm Addressable RGB LEDs - These will be used for debugging and user-feedback, different colors representing different messages\n* 1 Graphic LCD 128x64 - Mostly just tacked this on to get free shipping, but it could wind up in the project if we want another form of output\nWe're excited to get working on the hardware, but first up is preparing for our requirements presentation on next Thursday!",

They provided an installer that downloads an installer to do the actual installer in an unsafe manner. Thankfully I knew enough about packaging to wrap it up in a much saner manner.

It might not hurt to include situations like, \"What if the signal's fuzzy?\"\n\nWith Dr. Hauser\n\nDue to the large amount of unknowns with our project, the requirements might still be fuzzy. But that's okay since it's a draft.\nIt'd be neat to get the equipment before the presentation for the requirements document.\nThe class project web page should be in the introduction or in a special section near the end.\n\nDocument work summary\nAfter that, we continued working on the requirements document. Most of the work involved explaining requirements more technically and splitting up the tasks wherever they can go wrong. However, we're still a bit nervous that we may've not made the educational part of the description with the right amount of detail.\nFurthermore, the amount of technicality for the rest of the goals might've either been too much (in cases where we knew how to expand it) or too little (in cases where we're still not sure how to deal with it).",

      "text": "We set up our site for our github page last night using a Linux computer that already had nikola installed. Since we also needed to work on the site at school, we also had to set nikola up on school computers. To do this, we had to run the following commands:\n\nInstall most of the dependencies using pip\n\\Python34\\Scripts\\pip install --root=/path/to/destdir nikola\nInstall nikola using the github version\nEdit C:\\Python34\\Lib\\distutils\\msvc9compiler.py at line 294 to hardcode 12.0 as the MSVC version\nRemove all instances of -mcygwin from C:\\Python34\\Lib\\distutils\\cygwinccompiler.py\nInstall lxml using the official instructions for MS Windows and specify the path to install like in step 1.\nInstall blinker, six, markupsafe, logbook, natsort, yapsy, and pyrss2gen manually with pip\nConstruct a shell script file to automagically set environment variables to make manually copying nikola to a location where the executable can be run a lot less painful (as in, no need to type out extremely long path names): \n\nif test -d /cygdrive;then\n    #export PYPREFIX=\"/cygdrive/x/Apps/pylibs\"\n    export PYPREFIX=\"/cygdrive/c/Users/PLUCSCE/Downloads/pylibs\"\nelse\n    #export PYPREFIX=\"/x/Apps/pylibs\"\n    export PYPREFIX=\"/c/Users/PLUCSCE/Downloads/pylibs\"\nfi\n\nexport PYTHONPATH=\"${PYPREFIX}/Python34:${PYPREFIX}/Python34/lib:${PYPREFIX}/Python34/lib/site-packages\"\nexport PATH=\"${PYPREFIX}/Python34/Scripts:${PATH}\"\n\n\n\nWith the installation complete, all we had to do was keep a copy on our x drives before copying it to the Downloads folder and source the script file before continuing to work with our site.",
