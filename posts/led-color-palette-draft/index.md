Sat down and started whipping up a palette for the robot's LEDs and ran it through
[Visicheck](http://www.vischeck.com/vischeck/vischeckImage.php) to get a rough idea of how the palettes would look to color-blind people. The negative states are clearly
differentiable, but the positive emotions and the "I don't know" indicator isn't.

You can see the gallery [here](/galleries/LED_palette/).
