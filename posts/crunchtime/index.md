We give our presentation during the Natural Sciences Academic Festival in just under two weeks and the semester is coming to a close soon after. That means we're kicking our project development into top gear!

What have we been working on? Well our EEG headset is fully functional and capable of collecting data in realtime, but the trick is [classifying incoming waveforms](https://github.com/RoboBrainz/OpenBCI_EEG_Classifier) as emotional states from that incoming data. We're still trying to get that finalized.

The rover is fully operational and can perform a variety of different [movements](https://github.com/RoboBrainz/Thought-Reactive-Robot-Friend/tree/master/FancyMovement) that can be placed in our [database](https://github.com/RoboBrainz/Thought-Reactive-Robot-Friend/tree/master/ActionDBTest) and selected by the artificial intelligence.

Finally, we need to get all of our devices happily talking to each other, which we're also still working on.

Hopefully our next update will include some nice results, wish us luck!
