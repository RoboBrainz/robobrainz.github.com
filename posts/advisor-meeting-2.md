We met with our advisor today from 10:20-10:50 and reported our progress.  Here were the major points of the meeting:
# Joan
* Had to work on the Requirements Document mostly on own during the weekend (and likely for next week too).
* Concerned about how the use cases mention AndroidEEG
	* Draw the storyboards for the use cases without the Android app for the presentation. Including the Android app in the storyboards gives the illusion that Android middleman software will be essential to the functioning of the program.
	* Using the 1Sheeld may reduce the amount of Android code needed.
	* Keep it as optional in case the middleman software makes it easier to write the code.
	* Write the use cases to optionally communicate with the 1sheeld for debugging purposes.
* Found the data faker program in the Emotiv Epoc SDK (the binary's EmoComposer). Further comments about EmoComposer are in the [experiments](/posts/emotiv-epoc-sdk-experiments/) post.
* Can the data faker program be hooked up to the robot? That would be handy to debug the robot in case the headset readings get funky.
* Set up the presentation permissions for our advisor ASAP.
	* Meet with the advisor again (likely on own) at approximately 09:30 on 2014-10-28
	* Since we'll need a decent draft of our presentation to show to our advisor, pretend that the presentation is due on Tuesday.
	* Further comments on the presentation will be emailed.

## Personal notes that're related to the meeting
* The theme for the website could be updated. It looks a little plain compared to [my personal site](http://phora.github.io).
* Start learning about how heuristic functions are used in AI.
* Look at the [Numenta NUPIC code](http://numenta.org/nupic.html).

# Drew
* Unavailable for the meeting due to external circumstances.
* Checked up on the robot parts that came in the mail just in case anything happened to them.
* Ordered an LED(?) screen to get the free shipping. May come in handy later.
