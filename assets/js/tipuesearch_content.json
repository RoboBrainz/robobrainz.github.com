      "text": "Unfortunately, the project seems to drift farther and farther away even though\nwe're sure of the algorithms we will use to implement our robot. There's a draft EEG waveform processor that will most likely be using a bandpass filter in SciPy \nto reduce as much noise as possible from the outside by limiting the data to \n12.5 Hz to 30.0 Hz for the sensors that take EEG asymmetry into account for certain emotions (like sad\nevoking beta waves primarily on the left and happy evoking beta waves primarily on the right). The other sensors will most likely read facial gestures to further narrow the idenitified emotion. Alternatively, more\ncomplex classification trends can be found at an 10-20 function map.\nWhile we're working out the EEG classification, we've also started drafting skeleton code for the\ncart AI \nmaking use of the EDB library to persistently store scores for action/response pairs. Currently the available actions for the robot haven't been merged into the main code yet.\nHowever, the draft tool for quickly marking the OpenBCI board's data with emotion labels \nis refusing to store any of the packets that're retrieved through the OpenBCI Python API. \nThis is troublesome because the draft classifier uses the same library as the small tool for manually marking\nthe data before we store those into a folder that can be easily copied into the Rubix A-10 board so the EEG classification data can be easily modified. \nAdditionally, working with the A-10 also allows us to not worry as much about RAM constraints for processing the data.\nCurrently, here's the terminal output for our program.\npython2 manually_labeled_waveforms.py /dev/ttyUSB0 \n@Connecting to

Part of\nthis was due to needing to find a new meeting time to meet with our advisor,\npolishing what we had for the cart, understanding how to denoise data using\nthe FFT transformation of said data, and thumbing through the source code for\nthe OpenBCI boards.\nThere a few things that we discovered about using the OpenBCI boards in our project:\n\nWe'd need to find a way to install the RFDuino library so the Arduino IDE\ncan access it and properly program the dongle and the board.\nWe had to resort to stitching some vinyl onto some velcro to make applying the \nelectrodes to ourselves a lot easier.\nOur master plan of powering the OpenBCI dongle with 3V from the Arduino pin\ndidn't work. However, using a cut USB female cord does work to power it.\nAt some point, we need to solder the headers for the OpenBCI boards.\nWe'd need to find a way to write the firmware for the dongle so it can still talk\nto the OpenBCI GUI when plugged in. We're planning to have the dongle talk to the OpenBCI\nboard as a middle man so the rover can receive data from the board wirelessly. This\nwill be done over a serial established with two of the free pins on the dongle.\nIf the FFT calculations prove to be too much for the OpenBCI dongle, OpenBCI board,\nor the Arduino driving the cart, then we might need to get specialized hardware to do\nthe FFT calculations. Chances of this are pretty slim though since we have plenty of Arduinos.",

I applied for the refund, especially since we need the tests to be as early as possible.

      "text": "So I started playing around with the SDK and the SDK's provided tools. I've kept some screenshots to highlight some of the usability problems I encountered. The first two screenshots highlight aesthetic usability issues in EmoComposer since it tries to stick out with its widgets. The same could be said for the EmotivControlPanel, which also sticks out due to the custom styling on the buttons and other widgets. While I do have experience with writing Qt Style Sheets and the EmotivControlPanel even supports loading a custom stylesheet, this functionality is useless without documenting the widgets used to construct the interface. I'd recommend the Emotiv developers document what widgets the users need to write the stylesheets for for their SDK tools and/or remove all custom styling except for the custom widgets should they stick with a proprietary model. Personally, I'd prefer a combination of both so the Emotiv developers can keep their custom styling with a stylesheet, but allow the users to turn this off in case they can't easily read the interface.\nOther than that, the EmotivControlPanel works just as expected when tested with the EmoComposer, even though I frequently confused the \"Push Skill\" slider with carrying out the \"Push\" outside of training mode for the Affectiv Suite. The documentation does not mention that the EmoComposer can't save user profiles to it. Trying to do so will cause the EmotivControlPanel to freeze, requiring the user to manually kill the application.\nSurprisingly, the EmoKey and the TestBench software don't stick out as much. The only issues I encountered with it were not triggering when the blink button was pressed in EmoComposer, not fully closing even after \"Quit\" is clicked on the system tray (which again, requires the application to be killed manually), and not launching keybindings such as Alt+F3 (which brings up the window management menu for me) and Ctrl+Space (which launches Kupfer). Even with the QListView's row coloring, the custom colors are done correctly since it defines both a foreground color and a background color. This makes the software more accessible to people with unusual color schemes.\nI haven't been able to test the TestBench software since it has no ability to connect with the EmoComposer. Hopefully this'll change in the future, but I don't know what changes will be necessary to do this. At least it closes properly when Application \u2192 Quit is selected.\nI will also be documenting any experiences I have with Emotiv's developers in the future. So far, the support's been pretty responsive.",

The order consisted of:\n* 1 Multi-Chassis - 4WD Kit (Basic) - A rectangular chassis that has four independently-motorized wheels\n* 2 Motor Driver 1A Dual TB6612FNG - The intermediaries between the microcontroller (essentially the robot's brain) and the motors\n* 1 5 Pack of 5mm Addressable RGB LEDs - These will be used for debugging and user-feedback, different colors representing different messages\n* 1 Graphic LCD 128x64 - Mostly just tacked this on to get free shipping, but it could wind up in the project if we want another form of output\nWe're excited to get working on the hardware, but first up is preparing for our requirements presentation on next Thursday!",

They provided an installer that downloads an installer to do the actual installer in an unsafe manner. Thankfully I knew enough about packaging to wrap it up in a much saner manner.

It might not hurt to include situations like, \"What if the signal's fuzzy?\"\n\nWith Dr. Hauser\n\nDue to the large amount of unknowns with our project, the requirements might still be fuzzy. But that's okay since it's a draft.\nIt'd be neat to get the equipment before the presentation for the requirements document.\nThe class project web page should be in the introduction or in a special section near the end.\n\nDocument work summary\nAfter that, we continued working on the requirements document. Most of the work involved explaining requirements more technically and splitting up the tasks wherever they can go wrong. However, we're still a bit nervous that we may've not made the educational part of the description with the right amount of detail.\nFurthermore, the amount of technicality for the rest of the goals might've either been too much (in cases where we knew how to expand it) or too little (in cases where we're still not sure how to deal with it).",

      "text": "We set up our site for our github page last night using a Linux computer that already had nikola installed. Since we also needed to work on the site at school, we also had to set nikola up on school computers. To do this, we had to run the following commands:\n\nInstall most of the dependencies using pip\n\\Python34\\Scripts\\pip install --root=/path/to/destdir nikola\nInstall nikola using the github version\nEdit C:\\Python34\\Lib\\distutils\\msvc9compiler.py at line 294 to hardcode 12.0 as the MSVC version\nRemove all instances of -mcygwin from C:\\Python34\\Lib\\distutils\\cygwinccompiler.py\nInstall lxml using the official instructions for MS Windows and specify the path to install like in step 1.\nInstall blinker, six, markupsafe, logbook, natsort, yapsy, and pyrss2gen manually with pip\nConstruct a shell script file to automagically set environment variables to make manually copying nikola to a location where the executable can be run a lot less painful (as in, no need to type out extremely long path names): \n\nif test -d /cygdrive;then\n    #export PYPREFIX=\"/cygdrive/x/Apps/pylibs\"\n    export PYPREFIX=\"/cygdrive/c/Users/PLUCSCE/Downloads/pylibs\"\nelse\n    #export PYPREFIX=\"/x/Apps/pylibs\"\n    export PYPREFIX=\"/c/Users/PLUCSCE/Downloads/pylibs\"\nfi\n\nexport PYTHONPATH=\"${PYPREFIX}/Python34:${PYPREFIX}/Python34/lib:${PYPREFIX}/Python34/lib/site-packages\"\nexport PATH=\"${PYPREFIX}/Python34/Scripts:${PATH}\"\n\n\n\nWith the installation complete, all we had to do was keep a copy on our x drives before copying it to the Downloads folder and source the script file before continuing to work with our site.",
