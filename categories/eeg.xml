The initial &lt;br&gt;
plan was to lazily tag my mood while I was browsing the internet, coding, or doing art&lt;br&gt;
using the application that I wrote to live tag it so extracting the relevant data snippets&lt;br&gt;
for each mood would be easy. It turns out that this plan would fail fantastically since&lt;br&gt;
typing generates a lot of EEG noise. Even after the bandpass filter limiting the frequencies&lt;br&gt;
to the beta and gamma frequencies using the GUI (since I wanted to test first with the GUi&lt;br&gt;
to check if the connections were snug), there was a lot of activity in that range&lt;br&gt;
when I started typing. This'd make grabbing the test data for the emotions hard even though&lt;br&gt;
most of the activity is sedentary.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>EEG</category><category>openbci</category><guid>/posts/typing-causes-a-bunch-of-eeg-noises-too/</guid><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2015 04:22:15 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Crunchtime!</title><link>/posts/crunchtime/</link><dc:creator>pengor</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We give our presentation during the Natural Sciences Academic Festival in just under two weeks and the semester is coming to a close soon after. That means we're kicking our project development into top gear!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What have we been working on? Well our EEG headset is fully functional and capable of collecting data in realtime, but the trick is &lt;a href="https://github.com/RoboBrainz/OpenBCI_EEG_Classifier"&gt;classifying incoming waveforms&lt;/a&gt; as emotional states from that incoming data. We're still trying to get that finalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rover is fully operational and can perform a variety of different &lt;a href="https://github.com/RoboBrainz/Thought-Reactive-Robot-Friend/tree/master/FancyMovement"&gt;movements&lt;/a&gt; that can be placed in our &lt;a href="https://github.com/RoboBrainz/Thought-Reactive-Robot-Friend/tree/master/ActionDBTest"&gt;database&lt;/a&gt; and selected by the artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we need to get all of our devices happily talking to each other, which we're also still working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully our next update will include some nice results, wish us luck!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>arduino</category><category>crunchtime</category><category>EEG</category><category>linux</category><category>project</category><category>python</category><category>status</category><category>update</category><guid>/posts/crunchtime/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 19 Apr 2015 07:50:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
