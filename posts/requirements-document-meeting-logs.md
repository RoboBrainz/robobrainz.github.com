Here were the major points from our meeting with our supervisor, Dr. Michael Turi, and our capstone instructor, Dr. George Hauser:

# With Dr. Turi
* The description part of the requirements document is similar to the goals section of the proposal.
* The tasks we laid out should have a more pessimistic outlook.
* The use case template we pasted into the document is fine. It might not hurt to include

# With Dr. Hauser
* Due to the large amount of unknowns
